# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

This project implements a simple game that lets a user control a ball that eats the other balls flying across the screen.
The game keeps track of the number of balls and updates the count when each ball gets deleted.

To start the game (in VSCode), press 'F1', type 'Live Preview: Start Server', and hit enter. Use WASD keys to move the circle.
